//! TAR header definition taken from <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html>.
//! A Tar-archive is a collection of 512-byte sized blocks. Unfortunately there are several
//! TAR-like archive specifications. An Overview can be found here:
//! <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Formats.html#Formats>
//!
//! This library focuses on extracting files from the GNU Tar format.
