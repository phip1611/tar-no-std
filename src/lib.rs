//! Library to read Tar archives (by GNU Tar) in `no_std` contexts with zero
//! allocations. If you have a standard environment and need full feature
//! support, I recommend the use of <https://crates.io/crates/tar> instead.
//!
//! The crate is simple and only supports reading of "basic" archives, therefore
//! no extensions, such as GNU Longname. The maximum supported file name length
//! is 100 characters including the NULL-byte. The maximum supported file size
//! is 8 GiB. Also, directories are not supported yet but only flat collections
//! of files.
//!
//! This library is useful, if you write a kernel or a similar low-level
//! application, which needs "a bunch of files" from an archive ("init ram
//! disk"). The Tar file could for example come as a Multiboot2 boot module
//! provided by the bootloader.
//!
//! This crate focuses on extracting files from uncompressed Tar archives
//! created with default options by **GNU Tar**. GNU Extensions such as sparse
//! files, incremental archives, and long filename extension are not supported
//! yet. [gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/Formats.html)
//! provides a good overview over possible archive formats and their
//! limitations.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust
//! use tar_no_std::TarArchiveRef;
//!
//! // log: not mandatory
//! std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "trace");
//! env_logger::init();
//!
//! // also works in no_std environment (except the println!, of course)
//! let archive = include_bytes!("../tests/gnu_tar_default.tar");
//! let archive = TarArchiveRef::new(archive);
//! // Vec needs an allocator of course, but the library itself doesn't need one
//! let entries = archive.entries().collect::<Vec<_>>();
//! println!("{:#?}", entries);
//! println!("content of last file:");
//! let last_file_content = unsafe { core::str::from_utf8_unchecked(entries[2].data()) };
//! println!("{:#?}", last_file_content);
//! ```
