//! Library to read Tar archives (by GNU Tar) in `no_std` contexts with zero allocations.
//! If you have a standard environment and need full feature support, I recommend the use of
//! <https://crates.io/crates/tar> instead.
//!
//! The crate is simple and only supports reading of "basic" archives, therefore no extensions, such
//! as GNU Longname. The maximum supported file name length is 100 characters including the NULL-byte.
//! The maximum supported file size is 8GiB. Also, directories are not supported yet but only flat
//! collections of files.
//!
//! This library is useful, if you write a kernel or a similar low-level application, which needs
//! "a bunch of files" from an archive ("init ram disk"). The Tar file could for example come
//! as a Multiboot2 boot module provided by the bootloader.
//!
//! This crate focuses on extracting files from uncompressed Tar archives created with default options by **GNU Tar**.
//! GNU Extensions such as sparse files, incremental archives, and long filename extension are not supported yet.
//! [This link](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/Formats.html) gives a good overview over possible
//! archive formats and their limitations.
