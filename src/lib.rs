//! # `tar-no-std` - Parse Tar Archives (Tarballs)
//!
//! _Due to historical reasons, there are several formats of Tar archives. All of
//! them are based on the same principles, but have some subtle differences that
//! often make them incompatible with each other._ [(reference)](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/Formats.html)
//!
//! Library to read Tar archives in `no_std` environments with zero allocations. If
//! you have a standard environment and need full feature support, I recommend the
//! use of <https://crates.io/crates/tar> instead.
//!
//! ## TL;DR
//!
//! Look at the [`TarArchiveRef`] type.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! This crate is simple and focuses on reading files and their content from a Tar
//! archive. Historic basic Tar and ustar [formats](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/Formats.html)
//! are supported. Other formats may work, but likely without all supported
//! features. GNU Extensions such as sparse files, incremental archives, and
//! long filename extension are not supported.
//!
//! The maximum supported file name length is 256 characters excluding the
//! NULL-byte (using the Tar name/prefix longname implementation of ustar). The
//! maximum supported file size is 8GiB. Directories are supported, but only regular
//! fields are yielded in iteration. The path is reflected in their file name.
//!
//! ## Use Case
//!
//! This library is useful, if you write a kernel or a similar low-level
//! application, which needs "a bunch of files" from an archive (like an
//! "init ramdisk"). The Tar file could for example come as a Multiboot2 boot module
//! provided by the bootloader.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tar_no_std::TarArchiveRef;
//!
//! // init a logger (optional)
//! std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "trace");
//! env_logger::init();
//!
//! // also works in no_std environment (except the println!, of course)
//! let archive = include_bytes!("../tests/gnu_tar_default.tar");
//! let archive = TarArchiveRef::new(archive).unwrap();
//! // Vec needs an allocator of course, but the library itself doesn't need one
//! let entries = archive.entries().collect::<Vec<_>>();
//! println!("{:#?}", entries);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Cargo Feature
//!
//! This crate allows the usage of the additional Cargo build time feature `alloc`.
//! When this is active, the crate also provides the type `TarArchive`, which owns
//! the data on the heap. The `unstable` feature provides additional convenience
//! only available on the nightly channel.
//!
//! ## Compression (`tar.gz`)
//!
//! If your Tar file is compressed, e.g. by `.tar.gz`/`gzip`, you need to uncompress
//! the bytes first (e.g. by a *gzip* library). Afterwards, this crate can read the
//! Tar archive format from the uncompressed bytes.
//!
//! ## MSRV
//!
//! The MSRV is 1.76.0 stable.
